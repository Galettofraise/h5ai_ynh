## Disclaimers / important information

## Configuration

After installing the application, you can add documents in `/var/www/documents` (or the corresponding path you choosed).  
h5ai doesn't allow to edit or upload new documents directly from the web browser. But you can imagine coupling the folder `/var/www/documents` to Nextcloud or some sort of FTP to allow some users to upload content, and use h5ai as a public read-only interface.  
The main configuration file is `_h5ai/private/conf/options.json`. You might want to change some of the documented settings. But there are some more files in `_h5ai/private/conf` you might have a look at.
